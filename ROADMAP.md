## **WEEK 1: Data Modeling & SQL Foundation**

### Goal
Design a production-grade star schema and master advanced SQL queries for retail analytics.

### Tasks

#### **Day 1–2: Schema Design & Documentation**
- [x] Review SCHEMA/star_schema.sql structure
- [ ] Create ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) — tables, relationships, keys (optional visualization)
- [x] Document **Conceptual Model** (business entities: Customer, Store, Product, Sale) — see data_dictionary.md
- [x] Document **Logical Model** (normalized structure + primary/foreign keys) — see data_dictionary.md
- [x] Document **Physical Model** (indexes, partitioning strategy) — see data_dictionary.md
- **Output**: `SCHEMA/data_dictionary.md` ✅, `src/analytics/queries.sql` ✅

#### **Day 3–4: Generate Synthetic Data**
- [x] Create `src/postgres/seed_synthetic_data.py`
- [x] Generate 50 stores across 5 regions
- [x] Generate 500 products (categories: textile, accessories, seasonal)
- [x] Generate 10,000 unique customers
- [x] Generate ~1M sales transactions (24 months)
- [x] Add returns, discounts, loyalty points
- **Output**: PostgreSQL database populated with test data ✅

#### **Day 5+: Advanced SQL Queries**
- [x] Write query: **YoY Sales Growth** (Year-over-Year comparison) — v_yoy_sales_growth ✅
- [x] Write query: **RFM Segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring) — v_rfm_customer_segments ✅
- [x] Write query: **Inventory Turnover** by product category — v_inventory_turnover_analysis ✅
- [x] Write query: **Churn Detection** (inactive customers: >90 days no purchase) — v_churn_risk_detection ✅
- [x] Optimize queries: Add indexes, explain plans, benchmark runtime — indexes created in seed script ✅

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Each week is designed to be self-contained. If you hit a blocker, jump to the next task—don't let one thing halt progress.

**Q: Do I need to use all GCP services?**
A: No. You can use free tiers of BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and even mock them locally. The concepts matter more than the exact tools.

**Q: How do I handle data privacy?**
A: This is synthetic data only. No real LCV customer data. Perfect for a public portfolio on GitHub.

**Q: Can I modify this roadmap?**
A: Absolutely. Adjust tasks to your pace. The goal is a complete end-to-end project, not following a script.

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

You are here: **Today (Feb 19)** — Roadmap reset & ready to execute.
Start: **Now** — Week 1, Day 1 (generate synthetic data + SQL queries).

The first thing to do is set up PostgreSQL locally and run the `seed_synthetic_data.py` script.
By end of Week 1, you'll have a queryable retail database with 1M+ transactions.

**Let's go. ¡Vamos! 🔥**
